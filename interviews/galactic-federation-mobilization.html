        <section class="gin-article-body">
          <p>
            The <strong>Galactic Federation</strong> has declared a <em>&ldquo;massive mobilization&rdquo;</em> of troops, warships, and orbital assets across the
            <strong>Otik Star System</strong> after the industrial world of <strong>Orxas</strong> announced its independence and expelled all federal administrators.
          </p>
          <p>
            Federation Defense Minister <strong>Vaen Solari</strong> described the deployment as a <em>&ldquo;decisive but measured response to a coordinated rebellion&rdquo;</em>,
            saying the Federation was <em>&ldquo;moving to safeguard law, commerce, and peace in the Dyne Rift frontier.&rdquo;</em>
          </p>
          <p>
            Land, naval, air, and reserve divisions will carry out full-system maneuvers through midweek, Solari said, characterizing the actions as necessary to
            <em>&ldquo;optimize command, control, and communications under live operational conditions.&rdquo;</em>
          </p>
          <p>
            The mobilization, ordered directly by <strong>President Althea Drayn</strong>, follows days of escalating tension in the region after the <strong>Orxas Free Compact</strong>
            declared the planet&rsquo;s secession from the Federation Charter.
          </p>

          <h3>Federation Fleet enters the system</h3>
          <p>
            The <strong>7th Expeditionary Fleet</strong>, led by the <strong>Sol-Class Dreadnought GFS Archimedes</strong>, entered the Otik system&rsquo;s outer orbit late Tuesday. It is accompanied by
            two <strong>Aegis-pattern heavy cruisers</strong>, three <strong>Kawazei-line destroyers</strong>, and the <strong>relay command ship GFS Auralis</strong>, along with over 4,000 aerospace craft.
          </p>
          <p>
            Federation Command confirmed that an estimated <strong>18,000 personnel</strong>&mdash;including <strong>Groundline</strong> and <strong>Mechguard</strong> divisions drawn from nearby <strong>Otik III</strong>&mdash;are taking part in the exercises.
          </p>
          <p>
            Images released by the fleet show <strong>Vanta-class escort corvettes</strong> sweeping the upper atmosphere while troop carriers descend toward staging zones on Otik III, the barren moon being converted into a forward operations base.
          </p>

          <h3>Operation Continuum Anchor</h3>
          <p>
            Federation sources say the deployment is part of <strong>Operation Continuum Anchor</strong>, a stabilization campaign intended to <em>&ldquo;re-establish lawful governance on Orxas and secure key industrial sites.&rdquo;</em>
          </p>
          <p>
            The <strong>Orxas Free Compact</strong>, however, has denounced the operation as <em>&ldquo;a colonial assault disguised as bureaucracy.&rdquo;</em>
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>
              &ldquo;We built the Federation&rsquo;s engines. We mined the Graveglass that powers their fleets. Now we refuse to live forever as a source code for their machines.&rdquo;
            </p>
            <footer>&mdash; Compact Speaker <strong>Nareen Voss</strong>, broadcasting from <strong>Varen Spire</strong></footer>
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            Voss urged citizens to <em>&ldquo;stand firm in civic defense.&rdquo;</em> The Compact claims to have mobilized several hundred thousand militia volunteers, though independent verification is impossible under the communications blackout.
          </p>

          <h3>Resource politics behind the rhetoric</h3>
          <p>
            Orxas is a mid-ocean industrial world whose factories refine <strong>Graveglass Panels</strong> and <strong>Oblivion Ore Plates</strong>, key components for the Federation&rsquo;s advanced ship hulls and stealth systems.
          </p>
          <p>
            Federation officials insist the crisis is about <em>&ldquo;security and unity,&rdquo;</em> but analysts across the Dyne Rift suggest the real motive lies in maintaining exclusive control of Orxas&rsquo; resource flow to the inner sectors.
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>
              &ldquo;The Federation doesn&rsquo;t conquer. It incorporates. Every so often, a world remembers what freedom looked like, and the response comes in the shape of a carrier group.&rdquo;
            </p>
            <footer>&mdash; Political historian <strong>Ilra Ten</strong>, speaking from Aegir Station</footer>
          </blockquote>

          <h3>Weapons and troops on the move</h3>
          <p>
            Witnesses on Otik III report mass landings of drop-ships and Mechguard walkers, their hulls marked with the sigil of the <strong>Federal Security Directorate</strong>. Long-range sensors detected multiple <strong>F/A-97 Skyblade</strong> atmospheric fighters conducting low-orbit flyovers.
          </p>
          <p>
            Federation sources say the <strong>GFS Archimedes</strong> is coordinating real-time operations through a <strong>Neural Command Matrix</strong>, linking every ship and drone across the theater.
          </p>
          <p>
            The <strong>Federation Army&rsquo;s Groundline regiments</strong>, augmented with <strong>Neuroburst-stimulated troops</strong> produced at synthetic complexes, are said to be &ldquo;combat-ready&rdquo; pending authorization to cross the planetary perimeter.
          </p>
          <p>
            Meanwhile, at least <strong>two Aether-class Harvesters</strong> and <strong>one Atlas-class Extractor</strong> have been requisitioned from civilian guilds to serve as logistics vessels&mdash;a sign that the Federation expects a protracted occupation.
          </p>

          <h3>Local and regional fallout</h3>
          <p>
            Across the Dyne Rift, trade convoys are rerouting to avoid the Otik corridor. Fuel prices in Aegir&rsquo;s outer docks have spiked 11 percent. Independent stations are quietly debating neutrality charters should the conflict spread.
          </p>
          <p>
            A source within the <strong>Council of Accord</strong> on Aegir warned that <em>&ldquo;the Federation is testing how much pressure the frontier will tolerate before something fractures for good.&rdquo;</em>
          </p>
          <p>
            The <strong>Crucible Dominion</strong>&mdash;the Federation&rsquo;s ancient rival&mdash;has remained silent, but encrypted transmissions from the Verge fringe suggest increased activity among Dominion scout vessels.
          </p>

          <h3>Official statements</h3>
          <p>
            Minister Solari emphasized that the Federation <em>&ldquo;does not seek regime change&rdquo;</em> and that <em>&ldquo;talks remain open if the Compact returns to lawful status.&rdquo;</em>
          </p>
          <p>
            Still, an internal Defense memo obtained by <em>Nexi News</em> outlines contingency protocols for <em>&ldquo;orbital pacification and infrastructure seizure.&rdquo;</em>
          </p>
          <p>
            Federation spokespeople continue to frame the mobilization as a <em>&ldquo;peacekeeping maneuver,&rdquo;</em> but military analysts note the buildup matches the scale of full war readiness seen during the early <strong>Dominion Conflicts</strong>.
          </p>

          <h3>Uncertain future</h3>
          <p>
            With over <strong>15,000 Federation troops</strong> now deployed across the Otik system and <strong>Orxas</strong> reportedly sealing its orbital lanes, the standoff shows no sign of de-escalation.
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>
              &ldquo;They call it an exercise. But every ship&rsquo;s hot, every barrel&rsquo;s loaded. Feels less like practice, more like the first day of history.&rdquo;
            </p>
            <footer>&mdash; Anonymous Groundline sergeant stationed on Otik III</footer>
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            As of this cycle, the Federation&rsquo;s <strong>Operation Continuum Anchor</strong> continues&mdash;its official goal: <em>&ldquo;Reunification.&rdquo;</em> Its unofficial one, many suspect: control of the last free world in the Otik system.
