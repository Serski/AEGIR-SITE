          <p>
            Ida’s Grand Aurora Theatre hasn’t seen this much chaos since the “Glitter Plague” musical incident. After
            playwright-performer Adhemar Mann staged a play openly roasting the Cirie family and—by adjacency—Orion
            Industries, critics swarmed him backstage. Adhemar, blissfully distracted and possibly high on stage fog,
            delivered the following answers verbatim. Below is the full Nexi-verified transcript:
          </p>

          <h3>Q: “What was the intention of this play?”</h3>
          <p>
            <strong>A:</strong> “okay okay maybe we DID get a little too silly, well womp womp oh yeah right the interview. What was
            the question again? Thank you, um... The play was meant to represent the overly imponent reality of Orion
            Industries, which is one thing their people don't seem to notice because of minimal priviledges they're given”
          </p>
          <p class="gin-article-tags">Nexi Commentary: Translation: corporate overreach but make it slapstick. Also, yes—he said “priviledges.”</p>

          <h3>Q: “Do you look forward to doing other plays with this essence? Do you regret anything about the play?”</h3>
          <p>
            <strong>A:</strong> Adhemar was yet again caught out of focus, adjusting his illustrous false peace lily. “Ah... Yeah sure, chat
            it's either we cooked or got a bit too silly but in the end of the day it's not meant to be taken personal, thus
            why I will be having my next show in Eagle Republic, stay in tune for the dates and place!”
          </p>
          <p class="gin-article-tags">Nexi Commentary: Man said “chat” like he was livestreaming. The theatre crowd is still confused.</p>

          <h3>Q: “How do you feel about Alpheus’ response?”</h3>
          <p>
            <strong>A:</strong> “I took notice that he didn't see me after the play and instead contacted me throught my office receptionist 2
            days later, his message hit a little rough but eventually I was able to avoid a lawsuit by entertaining his lawyers.
            Hopefully we don't go through this again”
          </p>
          <p class="gin-article-tags">Nexi Commentary: “Entertaining his lawyers” is doing a LOT of work here.</p>

          <h3>Q: “Who is responsible for writing these plays, is it your associate Conan?”</h3>
          <p>
            <strong>A:</strong> “Kind of? We write our plays freely as that of a bard without plans for the day, eager to play to anyone
            willing to listen and give some coins”
          </p>
          <p class="gin-article-tags">Nexi Commentary: So, yes, the script was written in real-time chaos mode.</p>

          <h3>Q: “Some critics say your portrayal of the Cirie family bordered on defamation. How do you respond?”</h3>
          <p>
            <strong>A:</strong> “we did not mainly intend to have it viewed as defamation, but merely a comedic parody to their recent actions”
          </p>
          <p class="gin-article-tags">Nexi Commentary: Orion PR Department currently experiencing a collective migraine.</p>

          <h3>Q: “Is it true that the finale’s collapsing set wasn’t intentional? What exactly happened backstage?”</h3>
          <p>
            <strong>A:</strong> “The collapsing set was not meant as part of the play, but because nobody was harmed and the audience viewed it
            well then we'll claim it was so. We don't want this leaked to cut it off though” (not to be cut off)
          </p>
          <p class="gin-article-tags">Nexi Commentary: This is being leaked right now. Hello.</p>

          <h3>Q: “Last question: why was there a live goose on stage during Act III?”</h3>
          <p>
            <strong>A:</strong> “Oh yeah, then there was a goose, an audience member came up to the stage and threw it there, nobody was really
            sure what to do so he kind of became an extra 😂”
          </p>
