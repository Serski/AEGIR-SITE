        <section class="gin-article-body">
          <p>
            A major exploratory operation by the Eagle Republic has uncovered evidence of a previously unknown industrial civilization on the remote world Mont, sparking intense speculation and raising concerns throughout the Outer Territories. Military officials confirm the fleet dispatched to the system deployed under Tier-3 Investigation protocols reserved for high-value scientific or geopolitical targets.
          </p>

          <h3>Deployment Package</h3>
          <p>The task force manifest included:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>1 Heavy Frigate (ERS Resolute)</li>
            <li>2 Destroyers</li>
            <li>3 Corvettes</li>
            <li>1 Research Vessel (ERS Halcyon)</li>
            <li>200 ground soldiers deployed across two rear corvettes</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The corvette ERS Talon executed the initial descent to locate a safe landing zone. Early orbital sweeps already hinted at a planet-sized anomaly; once atmospheric scans cleared, the ruins came into focus.
          </p>

          <h3>First Contact or First Warning?</h3>
          <p>ERS Talon's landing party reported the following site indicators within minutes:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Massive metallic structures stretching across multiple continents</li>
            <li>Remnant power grids consistent with industrial-scale infrastructure</li>
            <li>Thermal anomalies from deep within abandoned factory stacks</li>
            <li>Intermittent electromagnetic signatures without stable origin</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            From a plateau overlooking a valley of rusted towers and collapsed machinery, troops secured a perimeter while researchers deployed portable labs. Dr. Lysa Verdan, senior xenologist on the scene, warned that <em>“these structures weren’t primitive—they were advanced… far more advanced than anything native life should produce without leaving behind a global signature.”</em> Structural dating suggests the ruins are centuries old, yet key equipment appears deliberately dismantled rather than weathered away.
          </p>

          <h3>A Whisper in the Dark</h3>
          <p>
            During the build-out of a surface communications relay, the landing team followed standard-contact protocol by broadcasting peaceful intent across all known bands. The only response was a faint signal, barely above static, carrying a single word: <em>“leave.”</em> No repeat transmission, no identifiable source.
          </p>
          <p>
            Soldiers later reported fleeting movement inside the ruins—shapes that left no thermal signature. Orbital scans meanwhile detected a massive metallic mass buried beneath the main facility, geometric in shape and almost certainly artificial. Details on the object remain classified.
          </p>

          <h3>Tension Across the Outer Territories</h3>
          <p>
            Officials insist “no hostilities have occurred,” yet the discovery is already prompting hard questions among nearby systems:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Is this a precursor species?</li>
            <li>Is the civilization extinct—or hiding?</li>
            <li>Was Mont abandoned… or evacuated?</li>
            <li>And why did the landing team receive a direct warning to leave?</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The Galactic Council has called for an emergency briefing. All Eagle Republic assets in the Mont region are on heightened alert, with reconnaissance wings mobilizing toward adjacent sectors. Officials refuse to confirm whether the find links to rumors of Preservation Worlds—planets quietly protected by major powers for undisclosed reasons.
          </p>

          <h3>The Story Is Developing</h3>
          <p>
            The Galactic Free Press will continue to follow this operation as new information surfaces. For now, neither the Eagle Republic nor any neighboring power has issued a formal claim over Mont. Many fear this marks the first chapter of a larger confrontation—a confrontation with civilizations far older than humanity imagined.
