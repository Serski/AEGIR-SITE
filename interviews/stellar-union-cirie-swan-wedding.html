        <section class="gin-article-body">
          <p>
            Darling readers, fasten your neural veils and charge your holo-feeds&mdash;because we still haven&rsquo;t recovered from
            <strong>the</strong> event of the century. We&rsquo;re talking about the wedding that eclipsed every merger, gala, and orbital coronation this side of the Aegir Sector.
          </p>
          <p>
            Yes, yes&mdash;<strong>Aurelia Cirie</strong>, the luminous heiress of <strong>Orion Industries</strong>, and <strong>Darius Swan</strong>, the company&rsquo;s dangerously handsome Chief Security Officer (and galactic heartthrob of countless datafeeds), are now officially <em>Mr. and Mrs. Cirie-Swan</em>.
            Or as the tabloids are calling them&mdash;<em>The Empire Couple.</em>
          </p>

          <h3>The proposal that bent time</h3>
          <p>
            According to sources within Orion HQ (read: every intern in Ida can&rsquo;t stop whispering), the engagement happened in the <strong>Sky Atrium of Orion Spire</strong> itself&mdash;at golden dusk, beneath the floating banners of the company&rsquo;s stellar fleet.
          </p>
          <p>
            Witnesses say Darius dropped to one knee right beside the original <strong>Cirie Charter Plaque</strong>, the founding artifact of the megacorporation. And when Aurelia said &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; the tower&rsquo;s AI reportedly triggered a spontaneous fireworks sequence visible from orbit.
          </p>
          <p>
            Rumor has it that Aurelia&rsquo;s engagement ring isn&rsquo;t just jewelry&mdash;it&rsquo;s cut from stabilized <strong>Graveglass</strong>, a shimmering material usually reserved for starship cloaking systems. The symbolism? <em>Love that shields, not hides.</em> We&rsquo;re collectively swooning.
          </p>

          <h3>The wedding of the century</h3>
          <p>
            When the golden invitations dropped (delivered by personal drone, no less), every executive, admiral, and influencer in the sector knew something monumental was coming. The venue: <strong>The Airling Hotel</strong>, perched over Ida&rsquo;s Crystal Skyway, where clouds shimmer with photonic ice.
          </p>
          <p>
            The theme? <em>Celestial Opulence.</em> Every surface glowed with bioluminescent orchids imported from Kezh&rsquo;kar&rsquo;s deep forests, while violinists played from suspended platforms that drifted across the room like satellites.
          </p>
          <p>
            Guests were served molecular champagne that literally sang&mdash;each bubble emitting an audible chime tuned to Orion&rsquo;s corporate anthem. And when the bride appeared&hellip; the entire crowd fell silent.
          </p>

          <h3>The dress that halted a city</h3>
          <p>
            Aurelia&rsquo;s gown&mdash;oh stars, where to begin. Designed by <strong>Maison Veyra</strong>, crafted from micro-threaded Graveglass silk and woven with <strong>nanolight sequins</strong> that shimmered to her pulse, the dress wasn&rsquo;t worn&mdash;it floated.
          </p>
          <p>
            Fashion analysts are still processing the sheer audacity of its engineering. When Aurelia moved, her veil refracted starlight into constellations&mdash;witnesses swear the <strong>Orion sigil</strong> appeared briefly over the aisle. The city&rsquo;s traffic grid paused for seven minutes during her entrance due to &ldquo;sensor glare.&rdquo; Coincidence? Please.
          </p>
          <p>
            As for Darius&mdash;our silver fox of the Federation frontier&mdash;he cut a figure so sharply tailored that half the guests needed a defibrillator. Custom Orion Security formalwear, black synthfiber suit, gold-threaded tie, and (of course) the discreet holster of a man who never stops being ready.
          </p>

          <h3>Tears, tenderness, and tradition</h3>
          <p>
            In a heartfelt tribute, Aurelia and her father, <strong>Alpheus Orion Cirie</strong>, walked together through <strong>Crystal Park</strong>, where her late mother is interred. The park was transformed into a field of white roses and projected memories&mdash;images of Aurelia&rsquo;s childhood flickered through the petals as she passed.
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>&ldquo;She built the woman who built Orion,&rdquo; Aurelia said in her vows, voice trembling just enough to break a thousand hearts.</p>
          </blockquote>
          <blockquote>
            <p>&ldquo;You were the shield I didn&rsquo;t know I was guarding.&rdquo;</p>
            <footer>&mdash; Darius Swan</footer>
          </blockquote>

          <h3>The afterparty that defied gravity</h3>
          <p>
            Once the vows were sealed, the newlyweds didn&rsquo;t just kiss&mdash;they ascended. Literally. The Airling&rsquo;s grav-field was inverted for the first time in history, turning the ballroom into a drifting sea of silk and starlight.
          </p>
          <p>
            Guests floated among clouds of luminous mist while a holographic orchestra performed <em>&ldquo;Symphony for Two Suns,&rdquo;</em> a composition written exclusively for the event by the famed maestro <strong>Koa DeLaney</strong>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Reports say the cake&mdash;a twelve-tier anti-grav confection&mdash;was nearly obliterated when a tipsy Trade Federation envoy tripped his hoverboots mid-toast. Thankfully, the crisis was averted (and yes, he apologized personally to the bride).
          </p>

          <h3>The power couple era begins</h3>
          <p>
            The next morning, the new <strong>Mrs. Cirie-Swan</strong> was already back on the holo-conference floor, seamlessly merging post-wedding bliss with post-industrial empire management.
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>&ldquo;Love is an enterprise. You either invest, or you fade.&rdquo;</p>
            <footer>&mdash; Joint statement from Aurelia Cirie and Darius Swan</footer>
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            Our holo-paps have already spotted the couple departing Ida aboard the <strong>Orion-class cruiser Seraphine</strong>&mdash;destination classified. Honeymoon in the Calisa system, perhaps? Or a business deal disguised as romance? Either way, the stars themselves seem to be watching.
          </p>
          <p>
            Until next time, darling readers&mdash;keep your feeds tuned to <strong>Closer-To-The-Stars</strong>, where power meets passion, and the cosmos is never short on gossip. Because in the Orion sector, even love glows like plasma.
