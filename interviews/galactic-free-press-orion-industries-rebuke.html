            GALACTIC FREE PRESS — BREAKING REPORT FEDERATION PRESIDENT REJECTS ORION INDUSTRIES’ REQUEST — DELIVERS FIERY DENUNCIATION
            Capitol Sphere, Prime Galactic Sector — In a stunning and unprecedented diplomatic rupture, the President of the Galactic Federation has formally and forcefully rejected a high-level diplomatic meeting requested by the frontier megacorporation Orion Industries, issuing what analysts are calling “the harshest presidential rebuke in over a century.”
          </p>
          <p>
            The controversy began earlier this cycle when Orion Industries submitted an elaborate agenda seeking direct talks with the President, including proposals for trade expansion, planetary ownership rights, scientific cooperation, and even political financial contributions. What followed was a strategic brief described by many political commentators as “brazen, confrontational, and stunningly tone-deaf.” In their message, Orion Industries claimed that Federation power was “rotting away,” that super-battleships were “wasted in their hands,” and that the corporation did not require the Federation’s approval. The brief also appeared to imply a willingness to rally separatist movements if cooperation was not granted. The President’s response was immediate—and explosive.
          </p>

          <h3>“INSULTING… PROVOCATION WRAPPED IN ARROGANCE” — PRESIDENT STRIKES BACK</h3>
          <p>
            In a sharply worded communiqué released from the Presidential Executive Chamber, the Federation leader condemned Orion Industries’ approach as: “Insulting. Provocation wrapped in arrogance.” The President further dismissed Orion’s attempt at leverage, stating: “You have never faced the Federation. Corporations have risen, postured, threatened, and bragged before. They no longer exist.” Diplomatic clearances for Orion CEO Alpheus Orion Cirie and Director Kendric Harris were not only denied—they were explicitly revoked and blacklisted from entry into any Federation-controlled territory or vessel.
          </p>

          <h3>A COMPLETE DIPLOMATIC SHUTDOWN</h3>
          <p>
            In a move rarely seen at the federal level, the President declared: “All diplomatic requests from Orion Industries are suspended indefinitely.” The swift-and-severe rejection has effectively frozen all future engagement between the Federation and Orion Industries, a corporation that—until this event—had never directly interacted with the central government.
          </p>
          <p>
            Political observers were taken aback by the intensity of the response. Senior analyst Dr. Velana Rhyss of the Inner Rim Institute for Geopolitical Studies stated: “This was more than a denial. This was a message to every corporation, frontier settlement, and separatist sympathizer: Do not challenge the Federation’s authority.”
          </p>

          <h3>SHOCKWAVES ACROSS THE FRONTIER</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Corporate worlds voiced concern over the Federation’s uncompromising stance.</li>
            <li>Federation loyalists praised the President for “putting an ambitious corporation in its place.”</li>
            <li>Separatist forums are reportedly “buzzing with speculation”, though security officials insist no risk of mobilization exists.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Orion Industries has made no public comment following the President’s remarks. Internal sources claim the CEO’s office is in “crisis containment mode.”
          </p>

          <h3>WHAT COMES NEXT?</h3>
          <p>
            This dramatic confrontation could reshape relations between the Federation and private frontier conglomerates for decades. Experts warn that the Federation may begin heightened monitoring of Orion’s frontier operations, corporations may become more cautious in approaching the central government, and separatist factions may interpret this clash as a sign of the Federation’s strengthening political resolve—not vulnerability.
          </p>
          <p>
            One thing is clear: <strong>Orion Industries attempted to enter the galactic stage with swagger—and collided headfirst with the full weight of the Federation’s authority.</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            As one veteran diplomat remarked:
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            <p><strong>“You don’t walk into the President’s office and talk like that.<br />Not unless you’re tired of existing.”</strong></p>
          </blockquote>
          <p><strong>Galactic Free Press will continue to monitor the fallout from this escalating political drama.</strong></p>
