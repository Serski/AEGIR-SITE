        <section class="gin-article-body">
          <p>
            A shocking development has shaken scientific and political communities across the Galactic Rim: an Orion Industries science vessel, the OIS Lumen’s Wake, has been confirmed destroyed in the newly catalogued Xang System, located at coordinates 52.77% / 78.72%. Orion Industries released a brief, controlled statement late last cycle: “We regret to confirm the loss of contact with the OIS Lumen’s Wake and all crew aboard. Preliminary data suggests hostile action by an unidentified entity.” Despite Orion’s usual secrecy, military channels across multiple sectors lit up simultaneously, indicating that the situation may be far more severe than initially disclosed.
          </p>

          <h3>A ROUTINE SURVEY TURNED DEADLY</h3>
          <p>
            The Lumen’s Wake—a state-of-the-art scientific research ship—entered the Xang system under standard peaceful exploratory protocol. According to encrypted logs recovered by Orion military forces, the vessel detected strange gravitational patterns, faint life readings, and unknown interference emanating from the planet Kela. Chief Science Officer Taya Montra transmitted a universal peace hail moments before disaster: “If you are out there… we come in peace… We seek knowledge, not conflict.” That message has now become her last known transmission.
          </p>

          <h3>THE FINAL MOMENTS — WITNESSED THROUGH SENSOR RECONSTRUCTION</h3>
          <p>
            Using long-range telescopic arrays and partial telemetry, military analysts recreated the vessel’s final seconds. A massive alien dreadnought, previously undetected due to advanced cloaking, materialized above the Lumen’s Wake. Before the science team could react, the unknown vessel fired a gravitational energy beam, obliterating the research ship in under a second. No escape pods launched. No distress beacon was activated. There were no survivors. Experts across the Rim have called the weapon “the most efficient single-strike ship-killer ever recorded.”
          </p>

          <h3>WHO ARE THE XANGOTHRONS?</h3>
          <p>
            Though Orion Industries has not publicly named the hostile force, leaked internal documents reference the term “Xangothrons”—suggesting Orion may already have preliminary intelligence. Dr. Halani Triss, xenocivilization analyst at the Arcturus Institute, offered cautious speculation: “The architecture on Kela resembles engineered megastructures. If the Xangothrons exist, they appear to be a highly advanced, deeply territorial species. Cloaking technology that can hide entire planets implies technological superiority.”
          </p>

          <h3>MILITARY RESPONSE — FLEETS ON THE MOVE</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>2nd Star Group placed on high alert</li>
            <li>27th Aegis Fleet repositioned to Xang’s outer approach corridor</li>
            <li>The battle-cruiser OISF Inquisitor pulled from its Polirsh patrol route</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Eyewitnesses report mass displacement of civilian traffic from nearby corridors, suggesting the region may soon become a conflict zone. The Orion Industries Security Force (OISF) has not issued a declaration of war, but analysts argue the destruction of a civilian science vessel is an act of open hostility.
          </p>

          <h3>WHAT HAPPENS NEXT?</h3>
          <p>
            Tensions rise as the Xang system now becomes the most dangerous uncharted zone in the Outer Spiral. Orion has vowed a “measured but decisive response.” Whether that means diplomacy… or vengeance… remains to be seen. The Galactic Free Press will continue to monitor the situation.
