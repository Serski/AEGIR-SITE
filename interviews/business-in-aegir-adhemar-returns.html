          <p>
            BUSINESS IN AEGIR — Adhemar’s curious show comes to Aegir Outpost. A transmission passed through Nexi News Feed on Cycle 2696.03.12 opened with an announcer’s greeting: “Ladies and Mentlegen, good morning. Do you remember Adhemar Mann’s chaotic presentation in Orion Industries? Well, he is back!”
          </p>
          <p>
            This return is less chaotic—yet packed with an unexpectedly eclectic troupe. Recently joined under the U.I.W.G. banner, Adhemar now travels with Logan Klay, Conan Arborius, and “other illustrious names not listed,” including a self-aware shout-out to “Mr. Not Appearing in Any Plays.” The latest production introduces an ancient tale from early Earth, long before mass pollution and humanity’s migration to this galaxy.
          </p>

          <h3>HELGA BRITANNIA, WULFHERE, AND ANCESTRAL CAMEOS</h3>
          <p>
            The drama reimagines the volatile marriage of Helga Britannia and King Wulfhere of Northumbria—the same Helga notorious for bombastic performances that once rattled audiences into temporary hearing loss. Onstage, Helga’s ugly cry precedes Wulfhere’s sudden death; vengeance follows as she parodically dispatches an unidentified Alfred of Sussex, blamed for the assassination, with a single, horrible scream.
          </p>
          <p>
            Observers noticed a wink to lineage: when Helga arrives at the castle, Adhemar slips in a cameo of his bard ancestor, Adhemar II of Hispania. The self-insert drew laughs from the crowd even as the tragedy unfolded.
          </p>

          <h3>RECORDED REACTIONS—AND A QUESTIONABLE CONSENT FORM</h3>
          <p>
            After the play, Adhemar released a recorded exchange with Helga—she “might’ve been consensual” to being on mic, according to his post. Reflecting on her actions, Helga told the troupe:
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>
              “I felt like it was something I had to do; no other solutions were possible at that time. The King of Sexland, Edgar ‘the Cruel’, kept Britannia in fear and starvation. The last straw was the assassination of my Wulfie... Hence, I comply with all of this is veridic.”
            </p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            Helga applauded Adhemar’s staging and, per his video caption, was “very over-fabulous looking—more weight is more fabric you can decorate.” Under her influential endorsement, the troupe has been welcomed to additional shows at Aegir Outpost.
          </p>

          <h3>DOOS NEXT—AND SCROLLING GOSSIP</h3>
          <p>
            Nexi News confirms Adhemar’s next planned play will be staged in Doos, Eagle Republic. As the transmission closed, a text crawl kept sliding sideways with a barrage of self-aware teasers: “See also: Adhemar is the best actor in the world he totally didn’t write this bro trust me. Adhemar Mann will host a play in Doos this month. Helga holds podcast session over how she hated Adhemar’s play and can’t recall any of this; she was likely drunk that night…”
          </p>
          <p>
            The Business Desk will monitor follow-up bookings—and any future collaborations between Adhemar’s crew and Helga’s fabulously loud entourage.
