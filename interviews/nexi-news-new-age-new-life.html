          <p>
            New Age New LIFE!!! Ajax vanished without warning for the past week, leaving the Republic grasping for answers.
            His last public appearance came during a high-stakes hearing on the Federation agreement, where his precise
            remarks on national safety were cut short by an abrupt security intervention. Special Investigation Agents in black
            metallic masks swept into the chamber, whispered urgently to the President, and escorted him out as the Hornet
            aircraft spun up for immediate departure.
          </p>
          <p>
            The sudden exit fueled public panic and speculation. The SIA stonewalled inquiries as rumors swirled that
            Federation talks had imploded or that an invasion threat was looming at the Republic’s rim. Days stretched with no
            official word—just the echo of that canceled meeting and the image of Ajax striding into a waiting transport.
          </p>
          <p>
            Tonight the silence finally broke. Ajax returned to the podium with blood-stained clothes, weary eyes, and a
            genuine smile. “Citizens of the Republic, I apologize for my disappearance. I have news that brings me great joy.
            My son was born not long ago. I was rushed to witness this moment. He is a healthy young boy with a strong heart
            already—a spitting image of the future of the Republic.”
          </p>
          <p>
            The President closed with a promise that his week-long absence had forged into a threat for anyone who would harm
            the Republic’s children: “Those that dare to lay a finger on my sons and the future sons and daughters of the
            Republic will meet the wrath of the fathers and mothers that stand before me today. We will fight to ensure the
            generations that come will be safe under the flag that stands as the symbol of liberty and freedom. May God bless
            this day and may you all have many more to come. Thank you.”
