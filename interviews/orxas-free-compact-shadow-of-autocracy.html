          <p>
            <strong>Orxas Free Compact: The Shadow of Autocracy Falls on the Federation.</strong> The long-held narrative of a
            coordinated, hostile separatist movement on the world of Orxas has been definitively shattered. What the Federation
            and its compliant media called a rebellion was, in truth, a desperate and righteous uprising of men, women, and
            children seeking relief from the shackles of corporate servitude and environmental poisoning.
          </p>
          <p>
            The movement, known as the Orxas Free Compact, was not a threat to the Federation's ideals of liberty, but a final,
            flickering embodiment of those ideals. Their courage, however, was no match for the brutality of centralised power.
            The Federation's 7th Expeditionary Fleet has reportedly crushed the Compact into dust, an act of sheer force that has
            sent shockwaves through the frontier worlds and even into the Core.
          </p>
          <h3>The Façade of Unity Crumbles</h3>
          <p>
            For millennia, the Federation has justified its existence and extraordinary powers as a necessary shield against the
            lingering threat of the Dominion. Yet, as the Dominion remains silent and watchful, the true evil appears to be
            metastasising within the Federation itself. The devastating pleas from those on Orxas for help suggest the Federation
            is rapidly becoming the very thing it was designed to combat—a ruthless, authoritarian regime.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Council of Accord's stark warning echoes across the sectors: "The Federation is testing how much pressure the
            frontier will tolerate before something fractures for good." The galaxy is witnessing Democratic Backsliding on a
            Major Scale.
          </p>
          <h3>Continuum Anchor: Stabilization or Systemic Assault?</h3>
          <p>
            The massive military deployment on Orxas, we have learned, was not an error but an action ordered by the President
            himself, a leader seemingly dedicated only to the preservation of his own status and the ability to control and
            enforce trillions of beings.
          </p>
          <p>
            The military action is officially labeled Operation Continuum Anchor, a policy the Federation claims is for
            "stabilisation." However, citizens across the galaxy see through this flimsy disguise. It is, by all observable
            evidence, a coordinated assault disguised as bureaucracy, targeting a world that simply dared to dream of something
            better. The fear is palpable: Orxas is likely only the most recent, and latest of many worlds that will or have faced
            this systemic repression.
          </p>
          <h3>The Unanswered Question</h3>
          <p>
            History will remember the people of Orxas—their bravery, their dreams, and their tragic fate. But the immediate,
            terrifying question remains: What fate befell them? Where are they now?
          </p>
          <p>
            The Federation's silence on the aftermath speaks volumes. Are there prisoners? Are there refugees? The Daily Dose
            demands accountability and transparent answers from the Federation government about the casualties and detainees from
            the Orxas Free Compact. The galaxy is watching, and we will not allow this injustice to fade into the archival
            obscurity of Federation files.
