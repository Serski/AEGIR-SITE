        <section class="gin-article-body">
          <p>
            A luminous silhouette, vast enough to blot the trench lights beneath it, glides through the thermal darkness of
            <strong>Togogh&rsquo;s abyssal sea</strong>—the newest and perhaps most haunting addition to known galactic life.
          </p>
          <p>
            Scientists working under <strong>Orion Industries&rsquo;</strong> colonization initiative on the recently terraformed world
            of <strong>Togogh</strong>, in the <strong>Polirsh System</strong>, have announced the discovery of an extraordinary
            deep-ocean organism they have named the <strong>Togogh Leviathan</strong>, or <em>&ldquo;The Mourncurrent.&rdquo;</em>
          </p>
          <p>
            The find—confirmed by expedition leader <strong>Wulfhelm Mannering</strong>—is being hailed as
            <em>&ldquo;the most significant biological discovery in Federation space since the Ysoli Gas Phantoms.&rdquo;</em>
          </p>

          <h3>A living current beneath the crust</h3>
          <p>
            The creature, first detected by geothermal sonar arrays during a routine seafloor mapping run, measures an
            estimated <strong>nine hundred meters in length</strong>. Its semi-translucent body glows in pulses of turquoise
            light, the rhythm matching seismic activity beneath Togogh&rsquo;s tectonic plates.
          </p>
          <p>Mannering described the initial sighting as &ldquo;like watching a thought pass through the water.&rdquo;</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>
              &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t swim—it <em>drifts</em> on the planet&rsquo;s heartbeat,&rdquo; he said during a holo-briefing broadcast from the
              colony platform <em>Orion&rsquo;s Crown</em>. &ldquo;It feeds not on flesh or plankton, but on <em>heat</em>. It drinks the vents
              themselves.&rdquo;
            </p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            Early drone footage shows the leviathan exhaling streams of superheated water from its ventral pores, creating a
            shimmering halo that refracts the light of its own body—an almost ethereal, cathedral-like glow in the abyss.
          </p>

          <h3>Harvesting the unharvestable</h3>
          <p>
            The Leviathan excretes a rare substance through its dermal canals: <strong>Vireline Extract</strong>, a pale-blue
            neural gel with psychoactive and empathic properties. Initial tests conducted by Orion Biotech and independent
            <strong>Synthetics Lab</strong> researchers indicate that Vireline can <strong>induce temporary emotional resonance</strong>
            between subjects—a shared awareness described by one researcher as &ldquo;communal dreaming made chemical.&rdquo;
          </p>
          <p>
            However, the compound&rsquo;s effects are unstable. At higher concentrations, Vireline causes <strong>memory bleed</strong>,
            an event where users experience fragments of other minds, sometimes permanently.
          </p>
          <p>
            Despite this risk, demand for Vireline has already surged through <strong>black-market channels</strong>. Analyst data
            from Aegir Station&rsquo;s <strong>Nexi Trade Network</strong> shows speculative pricing at up to <strong>12,000 credits per
            milligram</strong>—rivaling the market value of <strong>Neuroburst&trade; Stimulant Packs</strong>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Federation authorities have not yet classified Vireline under restricted substances, though internal communications
            suggest pending legislation.
          </p>

          <h3>A creature older than the colony</h3>
          <p>
            According to preliminary genetic and isotopic analysis, the Mourncurrent predates the colony&rsquo;s establishment by at
            least <strong>three million standard years</strong>, indicating that Togogh&rsquo;s oceans have supported complex biospheres
            long before Orion&rsquo;s arrival.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Leviathan&rsquo;s tissue architecture defies easy categorization: part organic, part crystalline. Biologist
            <strong>Dr. Enia Tarrow</strong>, who analyzed early tissue fragments recovered from submersible probes, said the
            organism&rsquo;s cells are &ldquo;arranged in filaments of living glass—a biological photonic network.&rdquo;
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>
              &ldquo;It&rsquo;s like it was built to think in light,&rdquo; Tarrow told <em>Federation Science Nexus</em>. &ldquo;Each pulse may not just be
              metabolism—it could be <em>language.</em>&rdquo;
            </p>
          </blockquote>

          <h3>Ethical fault lines and corporate ambition</h3>
          <p>
            While Orion Industries has claimed exclusive research rights under its chartered extraction license, the discovery
            has already drawn scrutiny from the <strong>Federation Ethics Bureau</strong>. Critics warn that the company&rsquo;s interest
            lies less in preservation than in profit.
          </p>
          <p>
            Dr. Tarrow and several staff have reportedly been placed on administrative suspension after refusing to authorize
            &ldquo;non-invasive harvest protocols&rdquo; designed to extract Vireline directly from live tissue.
          </p>
          <p>
            Off-record sources within <strong>Synthetics Division</strong> have described the company&rsquo;s containment module—
            codenamed <em>SIREN VAULT</em>—as &ldquo;an abyssal slaughterhouse.&rdquo;
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re not studying it,&rdquo; said one whistleblower. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re <em>milking</em> it.&rdquo;</p>
          </blockquote>

          <h3>The myth of the Mourncurrent</h3>
          <p>
            Among the newly arrived miners and deep-rig divers on Togogh, the Leviathan has already become a mythic presence.
            Rumors spread of its song echoing through the hulls of submersibles—a low, mournful vibration that some claim induces
            tears or vivid memories of lives never lived.
          </p>
          <p>
            The locals have begun calling it <em>&ldquo;The Mourncurrent&rdquo;</em>—a name drawn from the sensation of sorrow that seems to
            ripple through the water whenever the creature passes.
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t hear it,&rdquo; one diver said. &ldquo;You <em>feel</em> it remembering you.&rdquo;</p>
          </blockquote>

          <h3>Federation response</h3>
          <p>
            The <strong>Galactic Federation Department of Exobiology</strong> has dispatched a research envoy from
            <strong>Outpost Aegir</strong> to verify the findings. In a brief statement, the department praised Orion&rsquo;s
            <em>&ldquo;spirit of discovery&rdquo;</em> but warned against <em>&ldquo;premature exploitation of non-sapient megafauna in volatile
            biospheres.&rdquo;</em>
          </p>
          <p>
            Still, the Federation&rsquo;s record of oversight in frontier systems remains weak. Observers note that in previous cases,
            such as the <strong>Veyra-Null coral harvests</strong>, enforcement came only <em>after</em> species collapse.
          </p>

          <h3>A fragile wonder</h3>
          <p>
            For now, the Mourncurrent continues to drift beneath Togogh&rsquo;s geothermal seas—unbothered, or perhaps unaware, of the
            turmoil above. Its glow is visible from the colony&rsquo;s deepest hydro-windows, pulsing softly in rhythm with the
            planet&rsquo;s core.
          </p>
          <p>
            Whether it will remain a symbol of wonder or become another casualty of industrial hunger is uncertain.
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>
              &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not a monster. It&rsquo;s a memory of peace, moving through boiling darkness. And we are the noise that woke it.&rdquo;
